# DS401COLCalculator
A project for the Iowa State University data science capstone course. 

Our objective is to create a dashboard for undergraduate and graduate students to compare the cost in living in schools that they will likely be comparing. The motivation behind this project when so many other cost of living calculators exist is that many of the other calculators are primarily based on costs that don't apply to a 18-25 year old student. Namely in housing, we use rental data rather than housing data.
