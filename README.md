# DS401COLCalculator
A project for the Iowa State University Data Science capstone course. 

Our objective is to create a dashboard for undergraduate and graduate students to compare the cost in living in various college towns across the US. The primary motivation behind this project is that many of the existing calculators for cost of living factor in costs that would not apply to an average college student. A primary example is the cost of owning a single-family home, whereas this calculator uses the cost of renting a studio or 1-bedroom apartment.
